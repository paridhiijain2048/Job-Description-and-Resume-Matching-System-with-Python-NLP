# üß† Job Description and Resume Matching System with Python NLP

This project is a web-based application that streamlines the hiring process by matching a job description with multiple uploaded resumes using both traditional NLP (TF-IDF) and deep learning embeddings (Sentence-BERT).

It extracts text from resumes in PDF, DOCX, or TXT formats and uses semantic similarity techniques to rank resumes based on how well they match the provided job description.

## üöÄ Features

- **Job Description Input**  
  Recruiters can directly input or paste a job description into the web interface.

- **Resume Upload**  
  Upload multiple resumes in various formats (.pdf, .docx, .txt) for comparison.

- **Automated Text Extraction**  
  Extracts text from uploaded resumes using PyPDF2, docx2txt, or plain text reading.

- **Similarity Matching Algorithms**  
  - **TF-IDF** vectorization for keyword-based matching  
  - **Sentence-BERT** for deep semantic similarity analysis

- **Similarity Scoring & Ranking**  
  Each resume is scored and ranked based on how well it matches the job description.

- **Result Presentation**  
  Displays ranked resumes in the UI with match percentages and filenames

## üß≠ Future Improvements

- Use LLMs (like GPT or LLaMA) for better document understanding  
- Add applicant tracking dashboard  
- Integrate Named Entity Recognition (NER) for better skill extraction  
- Allow parsing LinkedIn profiles or URLs  
- Allow multiple job descriptions
